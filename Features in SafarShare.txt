I want these security Features to be included in my SafarShare website and app.
   
1. Verified User Authentication

    - Email & Phone verification during signup
    - Government ID verification (Aadhaar, Driving License) for drivers
    - Profile photo and name shown publicly for accountability
    - Admin can approve/reject driver accounts

2. Panic Button (SOS)

    -  In-app panic button for both drivers and passengers

    When pressed:

    - Sends live location to emergency contacts
    - Alerts nearby authorities (if integrated)
    - Notifies SafarShare support team instantly

        - Drivers must submit ID proofs and license

    Optionally verify:

        - Police clearance certificate
        - Vehicle registration & insurance
        - Manual or automated verification by admin panel

4. No Last-Minute Cancellation Policy

        - Passengers/drivers canâ€™t cancel a ride within a set time window (e.g., 2 hours before ride)

    If cancelled late:

        - Auto deduction of penalty amount upto 100% of the ride amount
        - Temporary suspension for repeated offences

5. Real-time Ride Tracking

    - Live location tracking using Google Maps or Mapbox

    - Notification alerts on pickup/dropoff progress

7. Ride Reviews & Ratings

    - Mandatory post-ride feedback from both parties
    - Reports and blocks against abusive/inappropriate behavior
    - Repeatedly flagged users get suspended automatically

8. End-to-End Encrypted Communication

    - Use private chat system inside the app
    - Prevent sharing of personal contact details
    - Chats are encrypted and optionally visible to admin for dispute resolution

9. Admin Dashboard for Monitoring

    Admin can:

        -  View all ride logs
        -  Track flagged users
        -  See ride history, panic alerts, etc.
        -  Ban or warn users based on violations

10. Secure Architecture

    - Use HTTPS across the site
    - Store passwords using bcrypt
    - Protect API routes with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and role-based access
    - Rate limiting and CAPTCHA to prevent bots/spam
